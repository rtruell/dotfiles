# got tired of running 'man' on a builtin command and getting only the stupid
# page with a list of builtin commands.  so, wrote this 'man' over-ride function
# that checks to see if the requested command is a builtin command and, if so,
# runs my 'bashman' function instead.
function man {
  cmd="$(basename "${1}")"
  if [[ `type -t "${cmd}"` == "builtin"  ]]; then
    bashman "${cmd}"
