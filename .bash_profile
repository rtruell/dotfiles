# found that when just starting iTerm normally, everything worked just fine.
# however, when right-clicking a directory in Path Finder and selecting
# "services/Open In iTerm", a number of errors occurred and none of the
# functions were loaded...but the aliases were.  turns out that's because when
# iTerm starts under that condition, it first changes to the selected directory
# and then processes the startup files...and because parts of the startup files
# look for files that don't exist anywhere but in the home directory, those
# parts fail.  so, the solution is to preserve the selected directory using
# 'pwd', change to the home directory, process all the startup fifles, and then
# change back to the selected directory.
